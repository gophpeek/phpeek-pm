# Observability

PHPeek PM provides comprehensive observability features for monitoring, debugging, and integrating with your existing infrastructure.

## In This Section

- [Prometheus Metrics](metrics) - Export metrics for dashboards and alerting
- [Distributed Tracing](tracing) - OpenTelemetry integration for request tracing
- [Resource Monitoring](resource-monitoring) - CPU, memory, and process resource tracking
- [Management API](api) - REST API for programmatic access and automation

## Quick Overview

### Metrics & Monitoring

PHPeek PM exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics for:
- Process state and health
- Resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
- Restart counts and failure rates
- Scheduled task execution statistics

### Tracing

OpenTelemetry-based distributed tracing provides:
- Process lifecycle spans
- Integration with Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, and other backends
- Configurable sampling rates for production

### API Access

The Management API enables:
- Runtime process control (start/stop/restart/scale)
- Configuration management
- Health status queries
- Integration with external orchestration tools
