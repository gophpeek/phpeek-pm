## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Write tests for new features
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request

## Code Standards

### Go

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Write tests for new features (aim for >80% coverage)
- Use structured logging with `slog`
- Handle errors explicitly
- Use interfaces for testability

## Testing

All new features must include tests:

- **Unit tests**: In `_test.go` files alongside source
- **Integration tests**: In `tests/integration/`

See [Testing Guide](testing) for detailed information.
